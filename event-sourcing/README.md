# Event Sourcing pattern

[Event Sourcing](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/event-sourcing) is an architectural pattern stemming from [Domain-Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) in which entities do not track their internal state by means of direct serialization or object-relational mapping, but by reading and committing events to an event store.

A simple implementation would be a container that is used to track append-only events, (no updates or deletes). This gives you a full log of historical events which can feed into multiple others systems. 

There are multiple notable benefits to this type of approach in application design. It is often paired with another architecture pattern, Command Query Responsibility System (CQRS) in a way that combines Cosmos DB's Change Feed to facilitate the read layer in this architecture, including implementing another architecture pattern also used with CQRS, [Materialized Views](../materialized_views/README.md). It can also simply enable a communications layer for sets of loosely-coupled services. 

While event sourcing can be implemented with various types of databases, this is pattern heavily used by developers building applications using Azure Cosmos DB. The ability for Change Feed to act as a centralized (and scalable) message publishing mechanism is a key reason for this. But there are other reasons as well, including:

1. Flexible schema: NoSQL databases generally allow for schema flexibility. Easy support for unstructured event data formats that are often in JSON formats align perfectly with the needs of event sourcing architectures.

1. Scalability: NoSQL databases are typically designed for high scale. Data volumes in event sourcing patterns can range from the thousands to millions of messages per second. An underlying database needs to scale and do so seemlessly. Azure Cosmos DB's scale-out architecture is well-suited here with highly elastic throughput and storage.

This sample demonstrates:

- âœ… This will show how to create an Azure Function that will simulate shopping cart events for an event sourcing pattern which appends events to Azure Cosmos DB.

## Common scenario

A common scenario for using the NoSQL event sourcing data pattern is in building event-driven microservices architectures. Event sourcing can be particularly valuable in such scenarios due to its ability to capture and store all changes to an application's state as a sequence of events.

### Scenario: Event-Driven Microservices Architecture

1. Microservices Communication: In a microservices architecture, different services communicate through events. When an event occurs in one microservice, it can be published to an event bus or event stream. Other microservices can then subscribe to relevant events and react accordingly, updating their own state based on the received events.

1. Decoupled Components: Event sourcing allows microservices to be loosely coupled. Each microservice focuses on handling its own events and state changes without needing to know the internal workings of other services. This leads to better separation of concerns and enables each microservice to evolve independently.

1. Scalability: As microservices communicate through events, they can scale independently to handle varying workloads. NoSQL databases, which are often used in event sourcing, are designed to scale horizontally, making them well-suited for supporting the high throughput of events generated and consumed by microservices.

1. Resilience and Event Replay: In the event of failures or system crashes, event sourcing enables easy recovery by replaying events from the event log. By replaying the events, the application can reconstruct its state and continue processing from the point of failure, ensuring data consistency and reliability.

1. Audit and Compliance: Event sourcing provides a complete history of events and state changes, offering a robust audit trail. This is valuable for compliance purposes and helps track and understand how the system reached its current state.

1. Event Versioning and Evolution: As services evolve, events can be versioned, and new event types can be introduced. This allows smooth integration with both new and old versions of services. NoSQL databases' flexibility in handling different data structures makes it easier to handle event versioning.

1. Event Replay for Testing and Analytics: Event sourcing allows easy replication of events for testing and analytics purposes. Developers can use a test environment to replay events and verify the behavior of services, while data analysts can analyze the historical event log for insights and business intelligence.

Overall, the NoSQL event sourcing data pattern is well-suited for event-driven microservices architectures, enabling scalability, resilience, and loose coupling among microservices. It's important to design the events carefully and choose the appropriate NoSQL database that fits the application's requirements and expected event throughput. Additionally, this pattern requires careful consideration of event schema evolution to ensure backward and forward compatibility as services evolve over time.

## Solution

This pattern provides:
- A full log of events, useful for auditing or point in time calculations.
- Change feed capability to enable multiple consumers to process new events.
- [Materialized Views pattern](../materialized_views/README.md) using change feed builds off the event store created with this pattern to support multiple views off the same source data.

## Sample implementation of event sourcing
In this section we will walk through a case study on how to design and implement event sourcing, provding code examples and review cost considerations that will impact the design.

Consider a shopping cart application for an eCommerce company. All changes to the cart should be tracked as events but will be queried for multiple uses by different consuming services. Event sourcing pattern is chosen to ensure all history is retained and point in time state can be calculated. Each time a change is made to the cart there will be multiple calculations downstream. Rather than have the application update multiple containers, the single event store collection `shopping_cart_event` will be appended with the change. The partition key will be `/cartId` to support the most common queries by the shopping cart service. Other services will consume data from the change feed and use solutions like [materialized views](../materialized_views/README.md) to support different query patterns.

In this example the state of all products in the cart is maintained as `productsInCart`. However, this could also be derived by each query or consumer if the application that writes the data does not know the full state.

Sample events in the event store could look like this:
```json
{
  "cartId": guid,
  "sessionId": guid,
  "userId": guid,
  "eventType": "cart_created",
  "eventTimestamp": "2022-11-28 01:22:04"
},
{
  "cartId": guid,
  "sessionId": guid,
  "userId": guid,
  "eventType": "product_added",
  "product": "Product 1",
  "quantityChange": 1,
  "productsInCart": [{"productName": "Product 1", "quantity": 1}],
  "eventTimestamp": "2022-11-28 01:22:34"
},
{
  "cartId": guid,
  "sessionId": guid,
  "userId": guid,
  "eventType": "product_added",
  "product": "Product 2",
  "quantityChange": 3,
  "productsInCart": [{"productName": "Product 1", "quantity": 1},
                     {"productName": "Product 2", "quantity": 3}],
  "eventTimestamp": "2022-11-28 01:22:58"
},
{
  "cartId": guid,
  "sessionId": guid,
  "userId": guid,
  "eventType": "product_deleted",
  "product": "Product 2",
  "quantityChange": -1,
  "productsInCart": [{"productName": "Product 1", "quantity": 1},
                     {"productName": "Product 2", "quantity": 2}],
  "eventTimestamp": "2022-11-28 01:23:12"
},
{
  "cartId": guid,
  "sessionId": guid,
  "userId": guid,
  "eventType": "cart_purchased",
  "productsInCart": [{"productName": "Product 1", "quantity": 1},
                     {"productName": "Product 2", "quantity": 2}],
  "eventTimestamp": "2022-11-28 01:24:45"
}
```

## Try this implementation

To run the function app for Event Sourcing Pattern, you will need to have:

- [.NET 6.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)
- [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools)

## Confirm required tools are installed

Confirm you have the required versions of the tools installed for this demo.

First, check the .NET runtime with this command:

```bash
dotnet --list-runtimes
```

As you may have multiple versions of the runtime installed, make sure that .NET components with versions that start with 6.0 appear as part of the output.

Next, check the version of Azure Functions Core Tools with this command:

```bash
func --version
```

You should have a version 4._x_ installed. If you do not have this version installed, you will need to uninstall the older version and follow [these instructions for installing Azure Functions Core Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools).

    [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/azure-samples/cosmos-db-design-patterns?quickstart=1&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fevent-sourcing%2Fdevcontainer.json)

## Create an Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account

1. If you don't already have an Azure Subscription, create a free Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account: (<https://cosmos.azure.com/try>)

1. In the Data Explorer, create a new database and container with the following values:

    | | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Database name** | `Sales` |
    | **Container name** | `CartEvents` |
    | **Partition key path** | `/CartId` |
    | **Throughput** | `1000` (*Autoscale*) |

**Note:** We are using shared database throughput because it can scale down to 100 RU/s when not running. This is the most cost effient if running in a paid subscription and not using Free Tier.

## Get Azure Cosmos DB connection information

You will need a connection string for the Azure Cosmos DB account.

1. Go to resource group

1. Select the new Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account.

1. From the navigation, under **Settings**, select **Keys**. The values you need for the application settings for the demo are here.

1. While on the Keys blade, make note of the `PRIMARY CONNECTION STRING`. You will need this for the Azure Function App.

## Prepare the function app configuration

1. Open the application code.

1. Add a file to the `Cosmos_Patterns_EventSourcing` folder called **local.settings.json** with the following contents:

    ```json
    {
        "IsEncrypted": false,
        "Values": {
            "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
            "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet",        
            "CosmosDBConnection" : "YOUR_PRIMARY_CONNECTION_STRING"
        }
    }
    ```

Make sure to replace `YOUR_PRIMARY_CONNECTION_STRING` with the `PRIMARY CONNECTION STRING` value noted earlier.

2. Edit **host.json** Set the `userAgentSuffix` to a value you prefer to use. This is used in tracking in Activity Monitor. See [host.json settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2?tabs=in-process%2Cextensionv4&pivots=programming-language-csharp#hostjson-settings) for more details.

## Run the demo

1. Start the function app to wait for HTTP calls. Each call should have a payload of a single CartEvent, then the function will save it to Azure Cosmos DB.

```bash
func start
```

To trigger the function to generate events and send to the function, you can make HTTP calls with each CartEvent sent as JSON. Review and run Program.cs to see this in action.

Open a new terminal and run the included Console App (Program.cs) which generates simple shopping cart events:
```bash
dotnet run
```

## Querying the event source data
Once you have run [the demo](./code/setup.md) which generates data, you can run queries directly against the event source container by using **Data Explorer** in the Azure Portal.

1. In Azure Portal, browse to you Azure Cosmos DB resource.
2. Select **Data Explorer** in the left menu.
3. Select your container, then choose **New SQL Query**. 
![Screenshot of creating a SQL Query in Data Explorer within the Azure portal.](./images/data-explorer-create-new-query.png)

The most common query for this append-only store is to retrieve events for a specific `CartId`, ordered by `EventTimestamp`. In this case only the latest event for a cart is needed to know the last status and what products were in the cart.

The Console App (started with `dotnet run`) used in the demo will print out `CartId` values as it creates events.
```
HTTP function successful for event cart_created for cart 38f4687d-35f2-4933-aadd-8776f4134589.
```
Copy the query below and paste into the query pane in Data Explorer. **Replace the CartId value** with a GUID copied from the Console App program output.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM CartEvents c
WHERE c.CartId = "38f4687d-35f2-4933-aadd-8776f4134589"
ORDER BY c.EventTimestamp DESC
```

More complex queries can be run on the events container directly. Ideally, they will still use the partition key to optimize costs while the change feed is used to build other views when needed. One example is if the source application did not track the `productsInCart` information. In that case the product and quantities in the cart can be derived with a slightly more complex query. This query returns a document per product with the final quantity. It filters to a specific cart and also ignores the events that do not include a product, such as cart creation or purchase. You can test this in Data Explorer, but remember to replace the CartId value with one generated by running the demo.

```sql
SELECT c.CartId, c.UserId, c.Product,
    Sum(c.QuantityChange) as Quantity
FROM CartEvents c
WHERE c.CartId = "38f4687d-35f2-4933-aadd-8776f4134589"
    and IS_NULL(c.Product) = false 
GROUP BY c.CartId, c.UserId, c.Product
```

## Summary

The event sourcing pattern makes sense for developers as it provides a full historical record of an application's state, enabling easy recovery from failures and ensuring data resilience. It supports scalable architectures, decoupled microservices, and flexible data schema, making it suitable for modern distributed systems. With an audit trail for compliance and regulatory requirements, event sourcing enhances system transparency. It also simplifies testing, analytics, and event versioning, empowering developers to build robust and adaptable applications that can evolve seamlessly over time.
